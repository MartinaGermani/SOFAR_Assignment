# SOFAR's ASSIGNMENT
The goal of this assignment is to build a simulation with ROS2 in which a robot follows a moving target at a fixed distance.

For doing that, first of all I installed the Nav2 project, which can be used in ROS2 whenever you have to deal with applications concerning the navigation of robots in the environment.
