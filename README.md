# SOFAR's ASSIGNMENT
The goal of this assignment is to build a simulation with ROS2 in which a robot follows a moving target at a fixed distance.

For doing that, first of all I installed the Nav2 project [1], which can be used in ROS2 whenever you have to deal with applications concerning the navigation of robots in the environment.
In particular, the simulation that I had to implement is commonly called "following dynamic point" maintaining a fixed distance, and I found a tutorial about it [2], which I adapted and analyzed appropriately. 

The simulation is based on the behavior tree `follow_point.xml`, which sets the behavior of the robot (`turtlebot3_waffle`) in the environment (`turtlebot3_world`), and whose scheme is shown below.

So, as you can see in the scheme:
- for following a moving target, it reprograms, with a rate of 1 Hz, a new path to pose and it sends it to the controller,
- for updating the dynamic target that the robot is following, the `GoalUpdater` node takes as input the current goal and it subscribes it to the topic /goal_update,
- for maintaining the robot at a desired distance from the goal, the action node `TruncatePath` allows to stay at a certain distance from the target, 
- the control node `KeepRunningUntilFailure` allows to control if there are failures in the path since in that case it stops to move.

Instead, for sending the update goals to Nav2, I used the `clicked point` button, which allows to publish the coordinates of the goal in the /clicked_point topic, that are sended to the behavior tree to the cpp file `clicked_point_to_pose`.

As launch file, which contains the configuration of the system (program to run, environments, arguments etc), I used `tb3_simulation_launch.py` in the `nav2_bringup` package of Nav2.

## Development environment requirements:
This simulation requires the full installation of ROS2 galactic, that you can install by following the steps here https://docs.ros.org/en/galactic/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html).


## Installation and use instructions:
To install the project, you can directly use the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/MartinaGermani/SOFAR_Assignment.git`

Before to build the environment with the `colcon build` ROS2 command, remember to modify the path for the parameter `default_nav_to_pose_bt_xml` inside `nav2_params.yaml`, that you can find in nav2_ws -> src -> navigation2 -> nav2_bringup -> bringup -> params. 

To execute the project, you must execute the following commands on two different terminals:


`ros2 run nav2_test_utils clicked_point_to_pose`


`ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py`
